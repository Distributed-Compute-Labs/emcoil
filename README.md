Exact mathematical solutions describing the electromagnetic force 
interactions arising between a two-layer ferromagnetic conducting tube 
and a coaxial bobbin coil, carrying a DC or AC current and traveling at 
constant velocity, are presented here. The research is aimed at 
exploring innovative electromagnetic propulsion technologies, with 
potential applications in futuristic maglev transportation systems and 
space elevators.
